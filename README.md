# MARMOSET_BRAIN_AGE_PREDICTION

This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at predicting the brain age of marmosets using MRI images. Brain age prediction can provide insights into neurological development and aging, potentially aiding in the study of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline.
