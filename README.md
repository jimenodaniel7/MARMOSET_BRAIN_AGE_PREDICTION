# MARMOSET_BRAIN_AGE_PREDICTION

This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at predicting the brain age of marmosets using MRI images. Brain age prediction can provide insights into neurological development and aging, potentially aiding in the study of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline.

Here there are two notebooks: one of them is for visualization of the images, as well as the brain extraction proccess. The brain extraction was achieved using a brain mask from a marmoset atlas (https://marmosetbrainmapping.org/).
The other file involves the creation, training and validation of the model used for brain age prediction. 

The project was done in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Sawiak and Dr. David Izquierdo.
